Small Office LAN Design using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates how to design and configure a simple Local Area Network (LAN) in Cisco Packet Tracer for practice and learning.

  -  Overviewüß† 

The topology includes:

2 PCs, 3 Laptops, and 1 Server

1 Cisco 2960 Switch

Static IP configuration for all devices in the 192.168.1.0/24 network

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Summary
-------------------------
Device	IP Address	Subnet Mask	Notes
PC0	192.168.1.1	255.255.255.0	Workstation
PC1	192.168.1.2	255.255.255.0	Workstation
Server0	192.168.1.3	255.255.255.0	Web/DNS Server
Laptop0	192.168.1.4	255.255.255.0	Client
Laptop1	192.168.1.5	255.255.255.0	Client
Laptop2	192.168.1.6	255.255.255.0	Client
